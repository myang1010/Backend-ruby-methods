# (6) Create a program block_function.rb.  
# It should have a function do_calc that calls a block using a yield statement.  
# The yield statement will pass the numbers 7 and 9 to a block, and then will print out the result.  
# Call the do_calc function twice in your program. 
# The first time, pass a block that adds the two numbers. 
# The second time, pass a block that multiplies the two numbers.  Your program should print out 16 and 63.

do_calc do |a, b|
   puts  a + b

do_calc do |a, b|
