#(4) Create a program sums.rb with two classes.
#(a) a class called Sum1 with an initialize method that takes two parameters 
# and sets the instance variable total to the sum of the two. Include a line at the top of the class: attr_accessor :total

#(b) a class called Sum2 with an initialize method that takes two parameters a and b 
#and sets the instance variable a to the parameter a and the instance variable b to the parameter b. 
#Create a method new_total inside Sum2 that returns the sum of the instance variables a and b.

#(c) In the mainline program, create instances of Sum1 and Sum2, passing 5 and 6 as parameters on the new statement.  
# Print out the total for Sum1.  Print out the new_total for Sum2.

class Sum1
    attr_accessor :total
    def initialize(param1, param2)
        @total = param1 + param2
    end    
end   

class Sum2
    def initialize(a, b)
        @a = a
        @b = b
    end        
    def new_total
        @a + @b
    end        
end   

sum1 = Sum1.new(5, 6)
sum2 = Sum2.new(5, 6)

puts sum1.total
puts sum2.new_total
